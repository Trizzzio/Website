# Trading, Coding & A Bit of Chaos

Hey there! I'm Patrick---an ex-academic turned market enthusiast, coder, and overall data geek. My background is in financial economics, where I spent years researching markets, crunching numbers, and getting way too excited about transaction costs. Now, I trade, build financial models, and tinker with algorithms while documenting my journey here.

Beyond the screens and spreadsheets, I'm happiest outdoors---whether that's climbing up a rock face, hiking through the mountains, or just getting lost somewhere with a guitar in hand. If I'm not staring at charts, you might find me playing chess (usually losing in spectacular fashion) or jamming out some tunes.

This site is my little corner of the internet where I share my work, ideas, and (occasionally) my questionable trading decisions.
