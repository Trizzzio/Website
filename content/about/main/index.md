 This site is all about trading, coding, and learning in public. You’ll find:
  
  - **Trading Blog:** A transparent look at my day trading journey — wins, losses, and lessons learned.
  
  - **Trading Materials:** Some extra resources, insights, and tools I find useful for trading
  
  - **Projects:** My coding experiments, mostly related to financial markets, but who knows what else might sneak in?
  
 It’s all here for anyone who finds it interesting (or just wants to see what not to do in trading). So, take a look around and enjoy!
